<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>During quantitative or statistical research, sometimes one may attempt to randomly sample from a large reservoir of data. For example, in k-fold cross validation, <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{k}</script> of the original data is randomly selected.</p>

<p>Give the original dataset of size <script type="math/tex">n</script> and a desired sample size <script type="math/tex">m</script>, a naive way of implementing a random sampling algorithm is to generate a random number <script type="math/tex">r \in [0, n - 1]</script> and then put the <script type="math/tex">r</script>th item  into the sample; the process is repeated until there are <script type="math/tex">m</script> items in the sample. However, this method does not work when dealing with streamed data (coming in indefinitely) because one does not have knowledge of <script type="math/tex">n</script>.</p>

<p>This post explores efficient computational apporaches for random sampling that covers the case where size of the original dataset is not necessarily known.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<h3 id="approach-1">Approach 1</h3>
<p>The first approach is to maintain a priority queue. Initially when no data is present the priority queue is empty. Then, A random number (usually between 0 and 1) is generated and assigned to each data item as a key. Traverse the dataset and push each item (paired with their random number key) into the priority queue, which sorts the items based on their keys, until the size of the queue reaches <script type="math/tex">m</script>.</p>

<p>Now, generate the random key <script type="math/tex">r_{m + i}</script> for the (<script type="math/tex">m + i</script>)th item as usual. Investigate the top element (item with largest key) in the priority queue: if its key is larger than <script type="math/tex">r_{m + i}</script>, remove it and push the (<script type="math/tex">m + i</script>)th item into the priority queue; otherwise, discard the (<script type="math/tex">m + i</script>)th item. The same is done for all the upcoming items; anyhow, the size of the priority queue will be maintained at <script type="math/tex">m</script>. This is equivalent to generating a random key for all items in a dataset and keeping the <script type="math/tex">m</script> smallest ones.</p>

<p>This method is easily understood. It requires <script type="math/tex">O(m)</script> space for storing the sample and <script type="math/tex">O(nlog(m))</script> time to process all the <script type="math/tex">n</script> samples (because <script type="math/tex">O(log(m))</script> time is required for pushing items into the priority queue).</p>

<p><em>Can it be done in linear time?</em></p>
<h3 id="approach-2">Approach 2</h3>
<p>Yes, but in a slightly more convoluted way, as described in <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/vitter.pdf">this paper</a>. To achieve such linear time complexity, traverse the dataset and put the first <script type="math/tex">m</script> items into an array of size <script type="math/tex">m</script> (indexed from 1 to <script type="math/tex">m</script>, for the sake of convenience). For the (<script type="math/tex">m + i</script>)th item, generate a random number <script type="math/tex">r_{m + i} \in [1, m + i]</script>. If <script type="math/tex">r_{m + i} \leq m</script>, replace the (<script type="math/tex">r_{m + i}</script>)th item in the array with the (<script type="math/tex">m + i</script>)th item; otherwise discard the (<script type="math/tex">m + i</script>)th item.</p>

<p>Now since accessing an array item at some known index takes constant time, this approach obviously needs only <script type="math/tex">O(n)</script> time in general, with the same memory requirement as the previous approach. However, how does this method guarantee that every item has the same probability of being present in the sample?</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">P(item_{k} \in Sample; n)</script> be the probability that after scanning <script type="math/tex">n</script> items, the <script type="math/tex">k</script>th item in the original dataset is in the final sample.</p>
<h4 id="case-1-k--m">Case 1: <script type="math/tex">k > m</script></h4>
<p>If <script type="math/tex">k > m</script>, the first requisite is that the random number <script type="math/tex">r_{k}</script> generated for the <script type="math/tex">k</script>th item should be smaller or equal to <script type="math/tex">m</script>. If so, the <script type="math/tex">k</script>th item can supercede the <script type="math/tex">r_{k}</script>th item in the sample. Since <script type="math/tex">r_{k} \in [1, k]</script> there is a <script type="math/tex">\frac{m}{k}</script> chance that <script type="math/tex">r_{k} \leq m</script>.</p>

<p>In addition, if the <script type="math/tex">k</script>th item is to remain in the sample until all <script type="math/tex">n</script> items are scanned, every subsequent random number <script type="math/tex">r_{k + i}</script> should not be equal to <script type="math/tex">r_{k}</script>; otherwise, the <script type="math/tex">k</script>th item which is now placed at the (<script type="math/tex">r_{k}</script>)th position in the array would be replaced. <script type="math/tex">P(r_{k + i} =  r_{k}) = \frac{1}{k + i}</script> and it follows that, for all <script type="math/tex">i \geq 1</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(r_{k + i} \neq r_{k}) = 1 - \frac{1}{k + i} = \frac{k + i - 1}{k + i}</script>

<p>Combining the two requisites above, <script type="math/tex">P(item_{k} \in Sample; n)</script> is obtained as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{m}{k}\prod_{i = 1}^{n - k}P(r_{k + i} \neq r_{k}) =  \frac{m}{k}\prod_{i = 1}^{n - k}\frac{k + i - 1}{k + i} = \frac{m}{n}</script>

<p>The same holds for all <script type="math/tex">k > m</script>.</p>
<h4 id="case-2-k-leq-m">Case 2: <script type="math/tex">k \leq m</script></h4>
<p>Now since the <script type="math/tex">k</script>th item is already in the sample, it needs to remain there until all items are scanned. All random numbers generated <script type="math/tex">r_{m + i}</script> should not be equal to <script type="math/tex">k</script>. In other words,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(item_{k} \in Sample; n) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n - m}P(r_{m + i} \neq k) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n - m}\frac{m + i - 1}{m + i} = \frac{m}{n}</script>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The two methods described above are the better known sampling algorithms. Their variants can also solve some additional problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What if sampling with replacement (the same item is allowed to appear multiple times in the sample) is allowed?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if each sample has a “weight” (some predefined probability of being selected in the sample)?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
