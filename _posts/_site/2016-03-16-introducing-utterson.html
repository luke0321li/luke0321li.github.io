<p>Utterson was built on top of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator, and  <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a>, a vanilla Jekyll install. It was designed and developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/alidcastano">@alidcastano</a>, to provide a minimal and unassuming theme, focused on what matters: you and your content.</p>

<p>Utterson provides a fully-functional setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Home Page with according navigation</strong> makes your site is easy to navigate.</li>
  <li><strong>Sliding email subscription form</strong> lets you can build your audience in a an unobtrusive manner.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Contact Form</strong> with <a href="http://www.formspree.io/">Formspree</a>, provides a way for your your readers easily reach you by email, without you having to reveal personal information.</li>
  <li><strong>Scrolling navigation bar</strong> for posts lets readers can easily go back to your home page.</li>
  <li><strong>Fade-in footer</strong> allows you to have one last call to action at the bottom of each post, without getting in the way of your content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, building off Poole’s vanilla install:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A holistic Jekyll setup</strong> (Layouts, config, <a href="/archive">archive page</a>, <a href="/404.html">404</a>, example pages and posts.)</li>
  <li><strong>Easily scalable</strong> text and component sizing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">rem</code> units in the CSS.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile Friendly Design</strong> so that your site can be accessed on any device.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like to see the theme in action, you can see it live on my <a href="http://alidcastano.com/">site</a>.</p>

<p>And, in case you’re interested, these are three other themes, also built by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a> on Poole: <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a>, <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com">Lanyon</a>, <a href="http://enfield.getpoole.com">Enfield</a>. But, if I’m honest, you’re best of picking this one. (;</p>
